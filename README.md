# Detection-of-anomalous-events-through-Association-Rule-Mining-in-CGM-Timeseries-Data

### Step 1: Extract the bolus insulin data from InsulinBolusLunchPartX.csv. This is the maximum insulin level in the vector. I_B
### Step 2: Find the maximum CGM from the CGMSeriesLunchPartX.csv file. CGM_M (Quantize, divide CGM values into bins, of size 10mg/dL. ~50 – 60, 60 – 70, 70 – 80, ……………… 350)
### Step 3: Find the CGM value that is at the time when the lunch was taken. I.e. the sixth sample. CGM_0 (Quantize, divide CGM values into bins, of size 10mg/dL. ~50 – 60, 60 – 70, 70 – 80, ……………… 350)

#### Extract these metrics from all lunch instances for all subjects. Report the most frequent itemsets for each of the subjects (Bin for CGM_M, Bin for CGM_0, Insulin Bolus)

#### Consider the rule of the form: {Bin for CGM_M,Bin for CGM_0 }→I_B Find the rule with the largest confidence for each subject.

#### Extract all rules that you observe. Calculate confidence of each observed rule. 

#### Find anomalous events by finding the least confidence rules. Rank rules according to confidence.  

### Expected Output
#### CSV File with most frequent sets. One row for each itemset. 
#### CSV file with largest confidence rules. One row for each rule. Rules are of the form {Bin for CGM_M,Bin for CGM_0 }→I_B
#### Anomalous rules, Rules with confidence less than 15 %. One row for each rule.
